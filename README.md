# SafeCo: Pick-and-Place Robot

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Project Link: https://github.com/sebguarna01/41013_Assignment2

**Task:** "SafeCo wants you to consider a plausible application for a pick-and-place robot that has a gripper" (Paul, 2023).

The team will embark on a project to expand SafeCoâ€™s product range and customer base. The project team has decided to delve into a project that looks at a robotic bar system's design, application and safety integrations. This RoboBAR will have multiple applications, from hospitality to luxury homeowners looking to upgrade their homes with futuristic appliances, events and more. This RoboBAR will involve two robotic arms working simultaneously: a Linear UR3 Dobot and a GoFa 5. The GoFa is proposed to make the drinks, and the Dobot will give the made drink to the consumer.
