**Task:** "SafeCo wants you to consider a plausible application for a pick-and-place robot that has a gripper" (Paul, 2023).

The team will embark on a project to expand SafeCoâ€™s product range and customer base. The project team has decided to delve into a project that looks at a robotic bar system's design, application and safety integrations. This RoboBAR will have multiple applications, from hospitality to luxury homeowners looking to upgrade their homes with futuristic appliances, events and more. This RoboBAR will involve two robotic arms working simultaneously: a Linear UR3 Dobot and a GoFa 5. The GoFa is proposed to make the drinks, and the Dobot will give the made drink to the consumer. 

### Overview
This submission contains the Project Demonstration documentation for the SafeCo: Pick-and-Place Robot Project by Group 50. 

### Criteria (Tasks):
System Demonstration (group task with the final Spark+ used to distribute these marks): 15/35

Demonstration of the new robot with an existing robot completing a specified task during an online (in class time) group presentation (10-15 minutes per group): Path plan between several poses and the final joint state given a  unique and safe environment (developed by each group) and the simulated model. Use RMRC, collision avoidance and a GUI where appropriate. Creatively use a real robot that mimics and/or enhances the simulation and application. (10)

Safety in Demo: (5)

(a) System reacts to user emergency stop action (1) GUI e-stop; (1) Hardware e-stop. (Minus marks if no e-stop).

(b) Trajectory reacts to simulated sensor input (e.g. light curtain) (1)

(c) Trajectory reacts to a forced simulated upcoming collision (1)

(d) Design a simulated environment with a strategically placed models of appropriate safety equipment (1)
