System Demonstration (group task with the final Spark+ used to distribute these marks): 15/35

Demonstration of the new robot with an existing robot completing a specified task during an online (in class time) group presentation (10-15 minutes per group): Path plan between several poses and the final joint state given a  unique and safe environment (developed by each group) and the simulated model. Use RMRC, collision avoidance and a GUI where appropriate. Creatively use a real robot that mimics and/or enhances the simulation and application. (10)

Safety in Demo: (5)
(a) System reacts to user emergency stop action (1) GUI e-stop; (1) Hardware e-stop. (Minus marks if no e-stop).
(b) Trajectory reacts to simulated sensor input (e.g. light curtain) (1)
(c) Trajectory reacts to a forced simulated upcoming collision (1)
(d) Design a simulated environment with a strategically placed models of appropriate safety equipment (1)
